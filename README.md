# PROJECT-Mastermind
This is my Ruby implementation of the Mastermind board game. This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)'s curriculum.

## Rules of the game
You can find a good description of the game's rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)).

## Implementation
My implementation of the game should be pretty straight-forward. For the computer's code guessing strategy I used [Knuth's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Worst_case:_Five-guess_algorithm).
